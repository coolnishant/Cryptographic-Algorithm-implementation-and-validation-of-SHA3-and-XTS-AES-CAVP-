# Cryptographic-Algorithm-implementation-and-validation-of-SHA3-and-XTS-AES-CAVP-
One of the important steps in certifying cryptographic algorithm is Cryptographic Algorithmic Validation Program (CAVP). NIST has enunciated a procedure for carrying out algorithmic validation as implemented for publicly known as well as non-publicly known key ciphers and their known variants. NIST has also provided for each of these algorithms a set of test vectors and expected response. The algorithm that we have chosen for implementation are hash function (SHA3 bit oriented) and block cipher mode of operation (XTS-AES). Their implementation is not publicly available. SHA3 algorithm uses Keccak Permutation. We have implemented the algorithm in Java language on Windows based OS.
